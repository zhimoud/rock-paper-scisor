2. Write unit tests with pytest "Pytest is a mature full-featured Python testing tool that helps you write better programs" - https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

## Docker file
You are required to create a Dockerfile that allows us to build a docker container and execute the tool with docker run without having any dependencies other than docker installed, the following is what a user should do to run the application or tests:
   * docker run -it pytest -v    should execute the unit tests
   * docker run -it              should execute the app

## What we are looking for
* Clean, maintainable and working code 
* Comments if/where appropriate
